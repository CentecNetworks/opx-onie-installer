OpenSwitch ONIE Installer
=========================

In order to create the OpenSwitch ONIE installer, you will first need to
create the OpenSwitch root filesystem image. 
To create the rootfs image, it is required to use the Docker container 
generated by opx_setup.

Please refer more about opx_setup at [opx-build](https://github.com/open-switch/opx-build/README.md)

The build process has been automated by build.sh script.

You require the following repos to build ONIE installer
- opx-build
- opx-onie-installer

After you clone the above repos, run the the below commands to generate
the ONIE installer image
$chmod 777 opx-onie-installer
$cd opx-onie-installer
$./build.sh

OpenSwitch rootfs is based on Debian 8.7 Jessie

OpenSWitch Linux kernel is based on
- Debian Jessie (Linux kernel version : 3.16.39-1), amd64
- CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS is enabled in kernel config

The build process pulls the Linux kernel image already built from
[linux-image](https://dell-networking.bintray.com/opx-apt/pool/jessie/linux-image/)

The root file system mainly incorporates
- openssh-server
- sudo
- default user name and password : admin/admin
- "admin" user added to sudo group

After successful build ONIE installer will be generated at "opx-onie-installer"
(e.g. opx-onie-installer-x86_64_generic.bin)
