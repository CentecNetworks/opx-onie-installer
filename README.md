OpenSwitch ONIE Installer
=========================

In order to create the OpenSwitch ONIE installer, you will first have to
create the OpenSwitch root filesystem image. In order to create the rootfs
image, it is required to use the Docker container generated by opx_setup.

This has been automated by the script build.sh. Simply run the following

    $ cd opx-onie-install
    $ ./build.sh
